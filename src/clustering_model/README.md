# K-Means Clustering Prediction Model
---

This directory includes clustering model construction and evaluation files. The files are organized by dataset tested.

## Prediction Models

**predict_cluster.py**
- Original model used, tested on validation sets

**predict_cluster_updated.py**
- Final model used, tested on test sets

## Model Evaluations

**100 Subset**
- 100_clustering_model_comparison.ipynb
  - original vs. final model on 100 playlist subset

**10k Subset**
- 10k_clustering_model_comparison
  - original vs. final model on 10k playlist subset
- 10k_clustering_model_comparison-update_model.ipynb
  - notebook created for "multiprocessing"; cells reported in the main comparison notebook.

**27k Subset (Full Dataset)**
- original vs. final model on the full dataset created for the project.

## Demonstration

clustering_model_demo.ipynb and optimalk_demo.png added for website demonstration.
